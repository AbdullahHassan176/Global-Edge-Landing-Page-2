- No hardcoded secrets in codebase
- Secure API endpoints with proper validation
- HTTPS enforcement in production

### Input Validation
- TypeScript for compile-time type safety
- Server-side validation for all API inputs
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
5. **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web security
6. **Use HTTPS** in all environments
7. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information

### For Deployment
1. **Use secure hosting** with SSL certificates
2. **Configure security headers** (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
3. **Enable logging and monitoring**
4. **Regular security updates** for the hosting environment
5. **Backup data securely** with encryption
6. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse

## üîê Security Tools & Monitoring

### Automated Security Checks
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: Code-level security checks
- **npm audit**: Package vulnerability scanning

### Manual Security Reviews
