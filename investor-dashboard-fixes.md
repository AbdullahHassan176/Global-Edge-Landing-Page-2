# Investor Dashboard Button Fixes

## âœ… **Issues Fixed**

### **Problem**
The Quick Actions and Recent Investment buttons on the investor dashboard were not working because they lacked proper navigation handlers.

### **Solution**
Added proper navigation functionality to all interactive elements.

## ðŸ”§ **Changes Made**

### **1. Added Router Import**
```typescript
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
```

### **2. Added Router Hook**
```typescript
const router = useRouter();
```

### **3. Added Navigation Handlers**
```typescript
const handleBrowseAssets = () => {
  router.push('/assets');
};

const handleViewReports = () => {
  router.push('/reports');
};

const handleAccountSettings = () => {
  router.push('/settings');
};

const handleViewInvestment = (investmentId: string) => {
  router.push(`/investments/${investmentId}`);
};
```

### **4. Fixed Quick Actions Buttons**
- **Browse Assets**: Now navigates to `/assets`
- **View Reports**: Now navigates to `/reports`
- **Account Settings**: Now navigates to `/settings`

### **5. Fixed Recent Investments Buttons**
- **View Investment**: Now navigates to `/investments/{investmentId}`
- **Browse Assets** (empty state): Now navigates to `/assets`

## ðŸŽ¯ **Working Buttons**

### **Quick Actions Section**
1. **Browse Assets** â†’ Takes user to assets page
2. **View Reports** â†’ Takes user to reports page  
3. **Account Settings** â†’ Takes user to settings page

### **Recent Investments Section**
1. **View Investment** â†’ Takes user to specific investment details
2. **Browse Assets** (when no investments) â†’ Takes user to assets page

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

### **How to Test**
1. **Navigate to**: `http://localhost:3001/investor/dashboard`
2. **Click Quick Actions buttons** - Should navigate to respective pages
3. **Click "View" buttons** in Recent Investments - Should navigate to investment details
4. **Click "Browse Assets"** in empty state - Should navigate to assets page

### **Expected Behavior**
- All buttons now have proper click handlers
- Navigation works smoothly with Next.js router
- Tooltips still work on hover
- No console errors or broken functionality

## ðŸš€ **User Experience Improvements**
- **Functional navigation** - All buttons now work as expected
- **Consistent behavior** - All interactive elements respond to clicks
- **Better user flow** - Users can easily navigate to different sections
- **Professional feel** - No more non-functional buttons

The investor dashboard now has fully functional buttons that provide proper navigation throughout the platform!
