# Fake Investments & Notifications Implementation

## âœ… **Problem Solved**

### **Issue**
User requested to add fake investments to view in the issuer and investor dashboards, and fix notifications buttons that were not working.

### **Solution**
Added comprehensive sample data to the database service and fixed notification functionality across all dashboards.

**Sample Investment Data:**
```typescript
const sampleInvestments: Investment[] = [
  {
    id: 'inv-001',
    investorId: 'investor-1',
    assetId: '1',
    amount: 5000,
    tokens: 100,
    status: 'approved',
    // ... complete investment data
  },
  // ... 4 more sample investments

    message: 'Your investment of $5,000 in Jebel Ali-Dubai Container has been approved...',
